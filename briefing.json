  "summary": "THREAT ASSESSMENT: HIGH. Currently tracking 179 military aircraft globally across all monitored nations. US forces have 162 aircraft airborne. Allied partners account for 17 additional tracked assets.\n\nINTELLIGENCE COLLECTION: 5 ISR and reconnaissance aircraft are active. Elevated recon activity typically indicates active target acquisition or battle damage assessment operations.\n\nSTRATEGIC INDICATOR: 33 strategic bomber(s) currently tracked airborne. Bomber deployments are high-visibility signals and may indicate signaling, training, or pre-strike positioning.\n\nADVERSARY ACTIVITY: No Iranian, Russian, or Chinese military aircraft currently broadcasting ADS-B. This is normal \u2014 adversary forces frequently operate with transponders off, particularly during sensitive operations.\n\nWATCH: Monitor tanker and ISR aircraft positioning relative to adversary territory. Any increase in adversary aircraft broadcasting combined with tanker surges warrants elevated attention.",
